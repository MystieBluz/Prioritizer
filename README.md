# Prioritizer ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

A remote hosted application that allows distributed teams a way to submit ideas and vote on which should be prioritized.

# Description

The Prioritizer provides a way for teams (especially remote teams) to prioritize product feature ideas when there are more proposals than resources available to implement them.

The application allows users to list proposed features for consideration and then allows team members to vote on the proposals they like. It will then list the proposals, by which ones received the most votes.

# User

- As a product manager, I have too many ideas to implement with limited resources to get them accomplished.

- I want the ability for a group of people to be able to vote on ideas as a way to prioritize them.

- As a user, I want the ability to be able to submit Ideas to be on a list for prioritization.

- As a user, I want the ability to vote on ideas I like so that my vote will help prioritize the idea.

- As a user, I want the ability to have multiple votes (with a limit) so I can add multiple votes to give an idea a higher priority.

- As a user, I want to know the time limit on how much time is left to vote.

- As a user, I want to see a final prioritized list of ideas ranked in order of which idea got the most votes.
